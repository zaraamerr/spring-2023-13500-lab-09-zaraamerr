* General instructions:
- Fill in your name and GitHub username on top.
- Use the Notes section to add any notes to the instructor.
- The main lab description can be found here:

*Note:* This lab will require doctest based tests.

* Tasks A-C

The code for Coord3D: 

#+begin_src c++
  #pragma once
  class Coord3D {
  public:
      double x;
      double y;
      double z;
  };
#+end_src

should be in a file named *coord3d.h* and should be included in the
files that use it. You include local files using quotes instead of
angle brackets. So, if you're in a file *funcs.h* and it uses the
Coord3D class you'd have this at the top: 

#+begin_src c++

// there could be other includes here
#include "coord3d.h"

// rest of funcs.h here

#+end_src


For task A, in addition to main printing out a Coord3D also put a test
in tests.cpp to test similarly. 

For tasks B and C, add the functions to *funcs.cpp* and *funcs.h*, run
from main and create doctest based tests in tests.cpp.

* Task D

complete this task as specified in the main lab. Don't incorporate it
into your main, Makefile, or tests.

* Task E

Add these functions to funcs.h  / funcs.cpp. Run from main and test
from tests.cpp.
